# Domains of the application

Using the Domain Model pattern $domain-model, we can divide the application into these domain:
- Configuration $configuration: configuring the program with user-defined options
- Extraction $extract: extraction of annotations
- Validation $validation: validating that the extracted annotation net is correct
- Preprocessing: modifying the annotations to fit their final form
- Export: generating the final documentation
