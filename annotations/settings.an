# Settings

Settings class at $settings-src is a class that contains all the options that configure the program.

It analyzes command line arguments to get paths to annotations, used language, output path, and others. If some argument isn't recognised, an exception is thrown.

It also builds a Checker $checker chain based on certain command line arguments (TO-DO)
