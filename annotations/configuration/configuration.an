# Program configuration

Before the program can properly start processing information, it first needs to be configured. The program can be configured using CLI arguments.

All the configuration is stored using a Settings object $settings-src. However, to instantiate it, you need to use a static lect::Settings::build_with_args method $settings-builder.

To properly use the program, you also need to specify the programming language used, which is then encapsulated inside the Language object $language, the instance of which is stored inside the settings.
