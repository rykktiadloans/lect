# Language builder methods

The language class uses builder methods for instantiation, which implement the builder pattern. It allows the clients to easily construct a language object instance that fits the currently used language, without having to figure out what exactly it would need to properly process text, making the application simpler.

The currently used methods are:
- Language::cpp() for C++ $language-cpp-src
- Language::placeholder() as a null object $language-placeholder
