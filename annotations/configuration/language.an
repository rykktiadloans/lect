# Language

Language class $language-src encapsulats all the data necessary for processing and extracting code annotations from a specific programming language, such as its extensions.

Class' constructor is privated, to instantiate one you have to use one of the static builder methods $language-builder, one for each supported programming language.

There is also a method for making a placeholder language object $language-placeholder that is mostly just a stub.

A language object also contains a $language-validator object for validating the captured code annotations.
