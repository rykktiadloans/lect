# Instantiating configuration

The Settings object $settings-src is tasked with holding all the information needed to configure the program, which means it's the configuration domain object. However, to instantiate it, you need to use a static lect::Settings::build_with_args method $settings-builder.

To properly use the program, you also need to specify the programming language used, which is then encapsulated inside the Language object, the instance of which is stored inside the settings.
