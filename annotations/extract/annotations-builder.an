# AnnotationsBuilder class

The AnnotationsBuilder $annotations-builder-src class is tasked with extracting the code and text annotations, and using them to instantiate the Annotations object. Thus, it is the extraction domain object $domain-object

It's methods extract_code_annotations and extract_text_annotations can be used to extract the annotations. They also return the AnnotationsBuilder object, so that they can be easily chained. The get_annotations method can be used to resolve and build the final Annotations object. 



This class implements the builder pattern $builder to abstract away the complicated extraction process from the consumers and to make the process of instantiating the annotations more straightforward
