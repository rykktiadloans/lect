# Preprocessing builder

PreprocessingBuilder $preprocessing-builder-src is a class that is responsible for constructing a function that takes annotations and converts/modifies them into a JSON document. Thus, it can be said to be the preprocessing domain object.

PreprocessingBuilder implements the Pipes and Filters pattern, since the final function is composed dynamically using other, smaller functions that each implement a specific transformation. In contrast to usual implementations of this pattern, ProcessingBuilder internally uses higher-order functions.

It also uses a builder pattern builder to abstract the internal function composition process from the clients.
