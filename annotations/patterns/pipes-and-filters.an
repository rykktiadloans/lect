# Pipes and Filters pattern

Pipes and Filters is a design pattern where the processing of data is separated into smaller subprocesses called filters, and pipes which pass data between filters. 

Such a pattern can improve flexibility and reusability, since we separate the concerns of the larger transformation process into smaller filters, which can be used in different parts of the application.

Instances of Pipes and Filters:
- $preprocessing-builder PreprocessingBuilder class
