# Builder pattern

Builder pattern is based on separating the internal representation of a class from its construction.

It is helpful when we want to hide the complicated specifics of the object's instantiation and contents, as well as control the exact steps of the object's construction.

Instances of builder:
- $building-preprocessing Preprocessing building
- $instantiating-configuration Config instantiation
- $building-language Language building
- $building-annotations Annotation Builder
