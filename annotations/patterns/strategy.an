# Strategy pattern

Strategy pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows us to group a family of related algorithms behind a single interface and select the one we need to use at runtime. Basically, it allows us to represent an algorithm as a value.

This allows us to decouple the class from its behavior and lets us limit the amount of potential derived classes.
