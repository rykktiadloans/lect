# Domain Object pattern

The core idea of the domain object pattern is to encapsulate a certain domain inside an object, which makes it easier to separate concern, as well as provide a relatively small interface to the other parts of the application.

The list of domain objects is:
- $settings Settings class for the configuration domain
- $annotations-builder AnnotationsBuilder class for the extraction domain
- $preprocessing-builder PreprocessingBuilder class for the preprocessing domain
- $checker Checker class for the validation domain
