# Chain of responsibility pattern

Chain of responsibility is a behavioral pattern that focuses on separating complex processing logic into separate linked handles, where each one can handle the input and/or pass it to the next one.

It allows us to easily dynamically construct chains/trees of handlers, where each one can handle the request and/or pass it to the next one.

Instances of the Chain of responsibility pattern:
