# Template method pattern

Template method pattern is a behavior pattern that defines a specific method in the base class that describes a high-level algorithm out of virtual functions, which can then be overridden by subclasses to define a new behavior.

It allows us to reduce code duplication by extracting the common algorithm logic to the superclass, while letting the subclasses to implements what they need.

Instances of template method pattern:
